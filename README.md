# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to the **JavaScript Learning Repository**! This repository contains all the notes, code snippets, and exercises I've worked on while learning JavaScript from the YouTube channel [Chai Aur Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode).

## About the YouTube Playlist

I followed the **Chai Aur JavaScript** playlist by Chai Aur Code, which is an excellent resource for anyone looking to build a strong foundation in JavaScript. The playlist is taught by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary), a seasoned developer and educator who simplifies complex concepts and makes learning enjoyable. You can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5iLG7sUa0&list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37).
